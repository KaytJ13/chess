#My notes:
-
- Still needs to be implemented (from the memory DAOs):
  - Maybe update `listGames` to be nicer
  - 


- Things to think about after talking with the TAs:
  - Potentially change the whole structure. Instead of a board being an array of arrays of positions:
    - The ChessBoard would have 2 arrays: white pieces and black pieces
    - Each piece would have a position variable
    - Position would no longer keep track of what piece is there
  - The things that would have to be updated:
    - ChessBoard:
      - Constructor
      - Instance Variables
      - Board getters and setters (delete & write new ones for white and black pieces)
      - AddPiece
      - GetPiece
      - GetSquare (could be deleted)
      - ResetBoard (would be way simpler)
      - Clone
      - Hash & equals
    - ChessPosition:
      - Instance Variables (no piece)
      - Get/SetPiece (delete)
      - Clone (wouldn't really need it . . .)
      - Hash & equals
    - ChessMove:
      - Nothing
    - ChessPiece:
      - Instance Variables (add a position, default null)
      - Getters and setters for position
      - Consider adding a "first move" boolean that then updates in the setter if the position is null
      - ToString, equals, & hash
    - ChessGame:
      - IsInCheckHelper (would loop through pieces, not the board)
      - FindKing (would be way simpler, loop through pieces)
      - CannotMove (again, way simpler)
