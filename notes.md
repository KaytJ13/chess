#My notes:
-
- Need to write code to individually create each square and add it to the board
  - The array can't just be made `new ChessPosition[8][8]` because each position has to be created with a row and column (based on their not 0 indexed position) 
- Need to write code for figuring out where pieces are before `pieceMoves(board, position)` code
