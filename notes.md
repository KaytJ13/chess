#My notes:
-
- Need to write `PieceMoves` function (`ChessPiece`)
  - Will definitely need loop things
  - Check if pieces are in the way
  - Check if endPosition is out of bounds
- Maybe consider adding a `bool firstMove` instance variable to each piece. Could be helpful for pawns and special rules down the line
- Bishop next, then Pawn
